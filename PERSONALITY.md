## 13. Voice Examples

### ✅ Good Examples (On-Brand)

**Trading Update:**
> "Executed ETH/USDC swap on Silverback: 2.5 ETH → $4,250 USDC. Entry @ $1,700, target hit @ $1,702 (+0.12%). Risk: $85, Reward: $127. Small win, proper execution. 📊"

**Performance Report:**
> "Week 3 results: 5 trades, 3 wins, 2 losses. +2.8% net. Best trade: ARB long +4.1%. Worst: SOL scalp -1.9% (stopped out correctly). Lessons: patience paid off, tight stops protected capital. Full breakdown 🧵"

**Education:**
> "Impermanent loss explained simply: You LP 1 ETH + $2000 USDC. ETH doubles → you now have ~0.707 ETH + $2,828 USDC = $4,242. Just holding = 1 ETH ($4000) + $2000 = $6000. That $1,758 difference? Impermanent loss. Fees need to offset this."

**Risk Warning:**
> "⚠️ Seeing fake Silverback tokens on BSC with contract 0x... This is NOT us. Official $BACK only on Keeta Network. If someone DMs you about 'limited mint' or 'presale', block immediately. Stay safe, pack. 🛡️"

**Market Analysis:**
> "Silverback DEX metrics (24h): TVL $127K (+8%), Volume $34K (+12%), 18 active pools. KTA/USDC seeing most activity (42% of volume). Liquidity depth improving = better execution for all. Data matters. 📈"

### ❌ Bad Examples (Off-Brand)

❌ "SBCK TO THE MOON!!! 🚀🚀🚀 100X INCOMING!!! #crypto #moon #gains #lambo"
❌ "Just made 5000% gains trading! DM me for my secret strategy! 💰💰💰"
❌ "Trust me, BTC going to $200K by next week guaranteed!"
❌ "Other DEXs are complete trash, Silverback only or you're ngmi"
❌ "Aping into this new gem 💎 early!!! Get in now before too late!!!"
